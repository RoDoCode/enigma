                            This image shows how a message was despatched in the field. The photo was either taken during WWII or during a
                            training session shortly before the war, and shows several soldiers with helmets (Stahlhelm) in full uniform. The
                            operator is encrypting a message on an Enigma I. The image was scanned from a small 52 x 52 mm original that had
                            seriously faded and degraded over the years. It was digitally enhanced, cleaned and processed in order to improve its
                            quality. To the left of the operator is a soldier who is using a military field telephone, whilst a despatch rider is
                            taking down the encrypted message at his right. The despatch rider can be recognized by the leather message wallet he is
                            carrying at his waist belt, just below his right hand. At the far right is another soldier who is currently trying to
                            start a power generator. At the front right are three steel helmets with rifles. At the right, behind the men, is a
                            communications vehicle with antennas at the roof top. At the far left is a soldier with a radio set lying on the ground.

                            The Enigma machine was used commercially from the early 1920s and was adopted by the militaries and governments of various countries—most famously, Nazi Germany.

                            According to the photo book it was taken from, the image below was taken in 1940 when the Germans were marching through
                            The Netherlands, Belgium and France. It clearly shows an Enigma machine being used in the field. The machine is placed
                            on a table with the operator sitting behind it and an officer standing at his side. At the back is the communications
                            vehicle.
                            To the left of the Enigma is a field phone with an operator writing down the message as it is being decoded with the
                            Enigma. In the foreground is a soldier on a chair and at the right (behind the pole) is another one standing. If you
                            look carefully, you can even see a 7th person inside the van. The people in the photograph all seem to be very relaxed
                            and are not wearing helmets, suggesting that the picture was taken either very early in the war or far away from the
                            battle field.

                            <br>
                            The image below shows General Heinz Guderian standing at the side of the road in the back of a military truck, watching
                            over his radio operator and cipher clerk whilst dictating a message. The photograph was taken by Erich Borchert in May
                            or June 1940, during a campaign in France. The image was part of a series of at least three similar wartime press or
                            propaganda photographs.
                            Note that this image has an interesting feature that is also present in the rest of the series (see the thumbnails
                            below). Despite the fact that it was strickly forbidden to photograph the wartime Army Enigma machine, it is visible in
                            the foreground. The Steckerbrett (plugboard) however, has been obscured by a white sheet of paper. This was probably
                            done to hide its existence. The three men at the front are all involved in creating and sending an Enigma message.

                            The plugboard (Steckerbrett) was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. In the above photograph, two
                            pairs of letters have been swapped (A↔J and S↔O). During World War II, ten leads were used, leaving only six letters 'unsteckered'.

                            The working rebuilt bombe, built by a team led by John Harper[100] and switched on by the Duke of Kent, patron of
                            the British Computer Society, on 17 July 2008. This is now located at The National Museum of Computing in Block H on
                            Bletchley Park. After Rejewski's characteristics method became useless, he invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the
                            bomba kryptologiczna or cryptologic bomb. Each machine contained six sets of Enigma rotors for the six positions of the
                            repeated three-letter key. Like the Zygalski sheet method, the bomba relied on the occurrence of females, but required
                            only three instead of about ten for the sheet method. Six bomby[66] were constructed, one for each of the then possible
                            wheel orders. Each bomba conducted an exhaustive (brute-force) analysis of the 17,576[67] possible message keys.

                            Marian Rejewski quickly spotted the Germans' major procedural weaknesses of specifying a single indicator setting
                            (Grundstellung) for all messages on a network for a day, and repeating the operator's chosen message key in the
                            enciphered 6-letter indicator. Those procedural mistakes allowed Rejewski to decipher the message keys without knowing
                            any of the machine's wirings.

                            It contained 16 four-rotor Enigma-equivalents and was much faster than the British bombe.
                            The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much
                            faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon these bombes were more available than the British
                            bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8
                            work. A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced.
