                            This image shows how a message was dispatched in the field. The photo was either taken during WWII or during a
                            training session shortly before the war. The operator is encrypting a message on an Enigma I. To his left a soldier is using a field telephone, whilst a dispatch rider is
                            taking down the encrypted message at his right. The despatch rider can be recognized by the leather message wallet he is
                            carrying at his waist belt.

                            The Enigma machine was used commercially from the early 1920s and was adopted by the militaries and governments of various countries—most famously, Nazi Germany.

                            This image was taken in 1940 when the Germans were marching through
                            The Netherlands, Belgium and France. It clearly shows an Enigma machine being used in the field.
                            To the left of the Enigma is a field phone with an operator writing down the message as it is being decoded with the
                            Enigma. The people in the photograph all seem to be very relaxed and are not wearing helmets, suggesting that the picture was taken either very early in the war or far away from the
                            battle field.

                            This shows General Heinz Guderian standing at the side of the road in the back of a military truck, watching
                            over his radio operator and cipher clerk whilst dictating a message. The photograph was taken by Erich Borchert in May
                            or June 1940, during a campaign in France. 
                            Despite the fact that it was strickly forbidden to photograph the wartime Army Enigma machine, it is visible in
                            the foreground. The Steckerbrett (plugboard) however, has been obscured by a white sheet of paper.

                            The plugboard (Steckerbrett) was positioned at the front of the machine, below the keys. In this photograph, two
                            pairs of letters have been swapped (A↔J and S↔O). During World War II, ten leads were used, leaving only six letters 'unsteckered'.

                            fifty-eight Western-front divisions because of decrypted messages.

                            the British Computer Society, on 17 July 2008. This is now located at The National Museum of Computing in Block H on
                            Bletchley Park. After Rejewski's characteristics method became useless, he invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the
                            bomba kryptologiczna or cryptologic bomb.

                            Marian Rejewski quickly spotted the Germans' major procedural weaknesses of specifying a single indicator setting
                            (Grundstellung) for all messages on a network for a day, and repeating the operator's chosen message key in the
                            enciphered 6-letter indicator. Those procedural mistakes allowed Rejewski to decipher the message keys without knowing
                            any of the machine's wirings.

                            The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much
                            faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon these bombes were more available than the British
                            bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8
                            work. A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced.
