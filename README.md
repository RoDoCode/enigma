# ENIGMA

ENIGMA aims to be an easy to use historical information repository, about the Enigma machines used during the Second World War and the people who cracked the codes. The target audience is beginners learning about the war and the code breakers history for the first time, or for enthusiasts who would like to find more in depth knowledge on specific topics. 
Searchers for this content may be children at school doing projects on the topic so the content is sensitive to this audience and avoids any specific content which might be disturbing or require parental guidance.  
The project hopes to interesting, informative and, easy to understand so that users can easily learn from their time on the site.

## Testing 

Testing has been conducted on all features of the Enigma up to its current status. All links lead to the relevant internal pages and external links, particularly for sources, have been tried and tested. Nav bar links have all been tested from each page to every other page. The responsive features all work as intended on each page. 

Test users have been used and observed navigating the site unaided, and asked to find their way to specific pages without prior knowledge of how to get there. All test users successfully navigated to their targets after less than a minute and in fewer than 4 clicks. 

The site has been tested via dev tools on a range of screens. The pages are responsive to changes in thedesktop window size changing. The site has been tested on: 1920x1080 monitor, 1082x1048 monitor and an iphone 13max screen.

Congratulations on completing your Readme, you have made another big stride in the direction of being a developer! 

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
