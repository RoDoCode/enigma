# ENIGMA

ENIGMA aims to be an easy to use historical information repository, about the Enigma machines used during the Second World War and the people who cracked the codes. The target audience is beginners learning about the war and the code breakers history for the first time, or for enthusiasts who would like to find more in depth knowledge on specific topics. 
Searchers for this content may be children at school doing projects on the topic so the content is sensitive to this audience and avoids any specific content which might be disturbing or require parental guidance.  
The project hopes to be interesting, informative and, easy to understand so that users can easily learn from their time on the site.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea


## Testing 

Testing has been conducted on all features of the Enigma up to its current status. All links lead to the relevant internal pages and external links, particularly for sources, have been tried and tested. Nav bar links have all been tested from each page to every other page. The responsive features all work as intended on each page. 

Test users have been used and observed navigating the site unaided, and asked to find their way to specific pages without prior knowledge of how to get there. All test users successfully navigated to their targets after less than a minute and in fewer than 4 clicks. 

The site has been tested via dev tools on a range of screens. The pages are responsive to changes in thedesktop window size changing. The site has been tested on: 1920x1080 monitor, 1082x1048 monitor and an iphone 13max screen.
