            Bletchley Park, British government cryptological establishment in operation during World War II. Bletchley Park was
            where Alan Turing and other agents of the Ultra intelligence project decoded the enemy’s secret messages, most notably
            those that had been encrypted with the German Enigma and Tunny cipher machines. Experts have suggested that the
            Bletchley Park code breakers may have shortened the war by as much as two years.

            The Bletchley Park site in Buckinghamshire (now in Milton Keynes), England, was about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of
            London, conveniently located near a railway line that served both Oxford and Cambridge universities. The property
            consisted of a Victorian manor house and 58 acres (23 hectares) of grounds. The British government acquired it in 1938
            and made it a station of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), designated as Station X. At the start of the war
            in 1939, the station had only 200 workers, but by late 1944 it had a staff of nearly 9,000, working in three shifts
            around the clock. Experts at crossword-puzzle solving and chess, as well as mathematicians and scientists, were among
            those who were hired. About three-fourths of the workers were women.

            To facilitate their work, the staff designed and built equipment, most notably the bulky electromechanical code-breaking
            machines called Bombes. Later on, in January 1944, came Colossus, an early electronic computer with 1,600 vacuum tubes.
            The manor house was too small to accommodate everything and everyone, so dozens of wooden outbuildings had to be built.
            These buildings were called huts, although some were sizable. Turing was working in Hut 8 when he and his associates
            solved the Enigma. Other new buildings were built from cement blocks and identified by letters, such as Block B.

            Despite the vital importance of the work, Bletchley Park still had trouble getting sufficient resources. Therefore, in
            1941 Turing and others wrote a letter directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who promptly ordered his chief of
            staff to “make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.”

            Operations were carried out under an injunction of strict secrecy that was not lifted even after the war ended. Only in
            1974, when Frederick William Winterbotham received permission to publish his memoir, The Ultra Secret, did the world
            begin to learn what had been achieved at Bletchley Park. The property is now maintained as a museum.
