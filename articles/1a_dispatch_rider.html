             as QQQ, to broadcast the settings to the receiver. Occasionally, the messages could be
            guessed:
            for instance, they often said maschine defekt.

            By 1936, in the run-up to war, the German military was tightening its communications. In October that year, the
            senders
            began to reset the Enigma machines daily. Dermot Turing credits another Polish mathematician, Jerzy Różycki,
            with
            realizing that this altered the frequency of letters, revealing extra information. The team developed tools to
            work
            through the hundreds of permutations, including punched cards and a mechanical device with rotors that mimicked
            Enigma,
            which, for uncertain reasons, the team called a bomba. Both concepts were later used and developed by Alan
            Turing.

            Bertrand fed this information back to Britain’s codebreakers, who come across in the book as humorous but aloof.
            They
            called the French dispatches — stamped TRÈS SECRET in red — scarlet pimpernels. In late July 1939, just over a
            month
            before the German army marched into Poland, Bertrand arranged for the respected British cryptologist Dillwyn
            ‘Dilly’
            Knox (who was already working on Enigma at Bletchley) to meet Langer’s team near Warsaw. The Poles wanted to
            pass on
            their knowledge. Initially angry that they had beaten him to it, Knox later sent the Poles a silk scarf printed
            with a
            horse-racing scene to concede that they had won.

            The British immediately ramped up codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park; within a few months, Alan Turing had
            re-engineered the bombes to work more quickly. The Polish insights saved him a year of work.

            When war broke out, the Polish radio-intelligence unit was wound up. The codebreakers buried their notes and
            machines
            and fled. Some ended up in Algeria, the rest in France working for Bertrand, who had set up a radio-intelligence
            group
            in a chateau in southern France. In breathtaking passages, the book reveals how most of the Polish codebreakers
            made it
            through the war, tapping into the French Resistance and dodging Germany’s military-intelligence services and
            secret
            police when France became occupied. As valuable assets, the codebreakers were not allowed to fight. Touching
            photographs
            in the book show them joking with each other and spending time with girlfriends amid the devastation.

            Eventually, Ciężki and Langer were arrested and interned in the Sudetenland (now part of the Czech Republic).
            After the
            war, they settled in Scotland. Palluth was killed in Germany in 1945, when an aeroplane factory in which he was
            working
            at Sachsenhausen concentration camp was bombed. Bertrand artfully played all sides. Avoiding becoming a double
            agent, he
            ended up a general. In 1972, he wrote a popular French book about Enigma, and so the story of X, Y and Z and
            Bletchley
            began to seep out.

            Dermot Turing's vivid and moving account sets the record straight.
