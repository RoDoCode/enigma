            During World War II despatch riders were often referred to as Don Rs (from phonetic spelling for D in "DR") in
            Commonwealth forces.[7] In World War II, Royal Corps of Signals soldiers carried out the role and the Royal Signals
            Motorcycle Display Team was formed from their number. They were also used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy,
            where they maintained contact with land bases and some of the riders were members of the Women's Royal Naval Service. In
            the UK, Bletchley Park initially received transmissions from the listening stations (Y-stations) by despatch rider, but
            this was later switched to teleprinter transmission.

            The British military often used Triumph, Norton, BSA, Matchless and Ariel for despatch riders, and although radio
            communications were much more advanced during WW II than WW I - huge numbers were produced (e.g. over 75,000 Norton 16H
            models).
